//JavaProgramming-Exception Handling Day1.


So what do we say is exception and exception handling?
Quite a common term eh? but still confused?

It's not hard to understand.

Exceptions are basically a problem or event that causes our code to crash and to be specific: they show problems during run time.
Quite not fond of errors myself.
It is always best to understand what the possible exceptions are .. what sorts of problem we would face when using an application.
Basically, when we use application we dont errors .. errors = exceptions.

So,we gotta handle the exception as properly as we could.
So, here i have got a basic example of Ehandling ..  that we have done since elementary school anything divided by 0 is a problem.

public class EHandling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example 1: normal division
        int a = 100;
        int b = 10;
        int result = Ex.xyz(a, b); // calling static method
        System.out.println("100 / 10 = " + result); // Output: 10

        // Example 2: division by zero
        int x = 50;
        int y = 0;
        int result2 = Ex.xyz(x, y); // triggers exception
        System.out.println("50 / 0 = " + result2); // Output: 0 and prints "Cannot divide by zero"

        // Program continues safely even after exception
        System.out.println("Program continues running normally...");
    }
}

// Class Ex contains method xyz to safely divide two numbers
class Ex {
    // Static method: no need to create an object to call
    public static int xyz(int a, int b) {
        int d = 0; // store division result
        try {
            d = a / b; // risky operation: might throw ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) { // catch division by zero
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return d; // returns 0 if exception occurred
    }
}
